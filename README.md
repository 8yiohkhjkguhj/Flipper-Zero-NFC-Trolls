## What?

I collected a few websites and videos i tought, it might be worth to have them in your pocket when you are around :)

Using Android, i wrote the links to empty NTAG_213BIT emulated by Flipper Zero.

Currently i did not manage to write as a standalone NFC file and I am not even sure if i am able to, since i don't own a NTAG.

*Solution? Hit me up*

## How to add?
Place the folder/s or file/s onto the SD-Cards folder for NFC, used by your Flipper.

**You have to add both files for each NFC-Tag, .nfc  and  .shd**

**Otherwise the tag will be read as empty**

Ã‰ voila :D 

Launch them on your Flipper, hold it near a device with NFC turned on and watch :D
