`Version: 0.3`
  `Added 13 NEW NFC files`

!! I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THESE LINKS/VIDEOS !!

This is my first GitHub Repo, please don't blame :)

You know any other site or want to share a video/website too?

## What?

I collected a few websites and videos i tought, it might be worth to have them in your pocket when you are around :)

Trolls // Funny stuff // Weird stuff // Helpful stuff

Using Android, i wrote the links to empty NTAG_213BIT emulated by Flipper Zero.

## How to add?
Place the folder/s or file/s onto the SD-Cards folder for NFC, used by your Flipper.

Ã‰ voila :D 

Launch them on your Flipper, hold it near a device with NFC turned on and watch :D
